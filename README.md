## topic-modeling-2

This is a copy from a YouTube tutorial that uses scikit-learn divide text from documents into 20 topical clusters,
and create a text file with the 10 most frequent words in each cluster.

The input text is already in one json file, but it is read into a list of strings 
where each string is the contents of one document, and that could be done without json.
